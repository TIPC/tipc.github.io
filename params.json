{"name":"TIPC","tagline":"Transparent InterProcess Communication","body":"==============\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nThe Transparent Inter-Process Communication protocol allows applications in a clustered computer environment to communicate quickly and reliably with other applications, regardless of their location within the cluster. TIPC originated at the telecommunications manufacturer, Ericsson, and has been deployed in their products for years. The open source TIPC project was started in 2000 when Ericsson released a Linux version of TIPC on SourceForge. A project Working Group was created in 2004 to oversee the project and direct the evolution of the TIPC protocol.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nThe TIPC project currently provides an open source implementation of TIPC for Linux, Solaris, and VxWorks. TIPC applications are typically written in C (or C++) and utilize sockets of the AF_TIPC address family. Support for Perl, Python, Ruby, and D is also available.\r\nTIPC project software is used in commercial, educational, and private products around the world.\r\n\r\n### Looking Ahead\r\n\r\nTIPC continues to evolve to meet the needs of its users. Users and developers who are interested in contributing enhancements or bug fixes to TIPC can obtain further information by contacting TIPC project team members on its mailing list.\r\nVolunteers interested in adding support for other architectures should contact the TIPC Working Group.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
